I found this lecture disappointing and exhausting.  
Rather than supporting students’ understanding, the lectures often made the material feel more confusing and overwhelming.

The lack of clear explanations and inconsistent pacing made it hard to follow the course.  
Even when questions arose, the lecture did not provide enough guidance to resolve them effectively.

This class gave me the feeling that students were expected to figure everything out on their own, without sufficient instructional support.  
Instead of encouraging learning, it created unnecessary frustration and anxiety throughout the semester.
